# Experience
## Study Experience
### Nankai University, Tianjin
Mar 2021 - Mar 2022 \
**Student Innovation Training Program, Leader**

- Simulated the optical path of the 3D-Bioprinting system and imaging process of DMD chips in ZEMAX (an optical design software), which can guide the improvement in 
control of precise structure.

Aug 2021 - Sept 2021 \
**Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling of China, Programmer**
- Aiming at adjusting the reflecting surface of FAST (Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope) so that it can receive more signals from universe.
- Worked as a programmer via MATLAB to model the surface of the FAST by the coordinate information of more than two thousand nodes and designed the policy of adjusting each node we need and the algorithm to evaluate our work, which shows by using our policy the FAST can receive 35% more signals.

Nov 2021 - Dec 2021 \
**Digital Circuit Final Project - 8 People Voting Circuit**
- Designed a voting circut using CD4013 as T' triggers, 74HC165 as register, 74HC161 as counter and NE555 as multivibrator producing clock signals. I also welded a circut board to implement the design and it worked perfectly.

Mar 2022 - Jul 2022 \
**Fundamental of Software Science and Computational Physics, Teachar Assistant**
- Gived lectures of numerical and symbolic computation and visualizing function of MATLAB and guided students to implement the algorithms introduced in the theory course via MATLAB.

## Intern Experience
